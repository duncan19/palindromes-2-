#### By _**Duncan Robbins and Lara Bjork**_

## Description

_This was an in-class project at Epicodus to practice arrays and looping. We also included if-else if-else statements. The task was described as: "A palindrome is any word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. Create a web page to identify whether or not a word is a palindrome. Bonus points: Make your code check a string of words. For example: "Hello olleH" is a palindrome by our definition."_
